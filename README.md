# Password-Manager
Stores passwords, along with usernames or emails, for websites in json

The program takes the website name, username or email, and password for each entry. An error message occurs if the user attemps to save with any of this data missing.

The user can use the 'generate password' function to create a 10-13 character long password of random letters, numbers, and symbols. This password is copied to the user's clipboard upon generation, as well as being saved in the json file.

The user can use the search button to print a username/email and password for a site to console when they have the website's name inputted. 

Input fields are cleared after passwords are entered.
